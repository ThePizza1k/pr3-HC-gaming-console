## Platform Racing 3 High-Color Gaming Console

This is a "gaming console" created for Platform Racing 3 Reborn. It boasts a display of 71x45, and can display 512 different colors!

The small resolution is due to a major limitation of how the display works: even a good PC can only handle about 180 pixel changes per frame.
As of right now, there is no known way to speed this up.

This code only works within Platform Racing 3. It requires the color palette set up next to it, and it is built for the level it is in.

The console is the dark grey block just left and up from the top left of the color palette.

The console is currently V1.5.1

Credit to gasterskyRAW for creating the original gaming console with 22 colors. This code is adapted from his for the 512 color palette.

Note: I have stopped working on this. The gaming console is pretty much complete, I don't really know what else is necessary.
